Recently, O
we O
developed O
a O
Fe-containing B-DSC
Li2S-based B-DSC
material O
( O
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
) O
as O
the O
sulfur B-APL

it O
has O
a O
relatively O
high B-ATTR

capacity I-ATTR
( O

) O
and O
electric B-ATTR
conductivity I-ATTR
. O

However, O
rapid O
capacity B-ATTR

was O
observed O
during O
the O
initial O
several O
cycles, O
due O
to O
some O
unknown O
reactions O
between O
the O
electrolyte O
and O
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
. O

In O
this O
study O
we O
demonstrate O
an O
effective O
method O
to O
improve O
the O
cycle B-ATTR
performance I-ATTR
of O
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
by O
coating O
its O
surface O
with O
a O
stabilizing O
material O
. O

We O
selected O
titanium B-MAT
oxide I-MAT
as O
the O
coating O
material, O
based O
on O
its O
high B-ATTR
stability I-ATTR
toward O
liquid O
electrolytes O
and O
its O
strong O
interaction O
with O
sulfur B-MAT
. O

Hence, O
we O
obtained O
TiOx-coated B-DSC
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
particles O
( O
Li8FeS5-TiOx B-MAT
) O
by O
a O
liquid-phase B-MET
reaction I-MET
. O

The O

observation O
revealed O
that O
the O
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
particles O
were O
coated O
with O
several O
tens O
of O
nanometers O
of O
TiOx B-MAT
layers B-DSC
. O

The O
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
- O
TiOx B-MAT
cells O
exhibited O
improved B-ATTR
cycling I-ATTR
performance I-ATTR
with O
a O
carbonate B-MAT
electrolyte B-APL
. O

We O
also O
observed O
that O
the O
capacity B-ATTR
originating O
from O
an O
iron O
redox O
was O
not O
affected O
by O
coating O
during O
the O
cycling O
test; O
in O
contrast, O
the O
degradation O
of O
the O
cell O
capacity B-ATTR
corresponding O
to O
the O
sulfur B-MAT
redox O
was O
suppressed O
significantly O
after O
coating O

the O
TiOx B-MAT

. O

Thus, O
the O
surface O

of O
Li8FeS5 B-MAT
with O
the O
electrolyte, O
which O
could O
be O
the O
main O
reason O

was O
effectively O

coating O

Conventional O

suffer O
from O

during O

because O
of O

polycrystalline B-DSC

Despite O

its O

Herein, O

discovered O
under O

Owing O
to O
their O

even O
after O

nickel-rich O
materials O
are O
degraded O

This O
inhomogeneous O
degradation O
behavior O
of O
nickel-rich O

at O

originates O
from O
the O
overutilization O

causing O
a O

In O
addition, O
this O

continuously O

Consequently, O
considering O
the O
degradation O

this O

suggests O
the O
adoption O

Nickel-rich O

are O

Unfortunately, O
reducing O

is O
challenging O
because O
of O
the O

Therefore, O
the O

We O

Both O

that O

As O

with O

without O

the O

an O

Moreover, O
the O

Therefore, O

have O
been O
under O
intense O
investigation O
as O
high-energy B-APL

because O
of O
their O
high B-ATTR

(1-3) O
. O

However, O
the O

been O
severely O
hindered O

at O
the O

Here, O
we O
report O

with O
a O
very B-ATTR

Using O

The O

that O
this O

is O
promising O
for O

that O

Nickel-rich O

promising O
cathodes B-APL

owing O
to O
their O
high B-ATTR

However, O
during O

nickel-rich O
cathodes B-APL

especially O
in O
case O

leading O

therefore O
imposing O

Here, O
we O

We O
demonstrate O
that O

This O

Nickel-rich O
material O
has O
the O
advantages O
of O
high B-ATTR

low B-ATTR

, O
so O
it O
is O
an O
attractive O
cathode B-APL
material O
. O

However, O
the O
defects O
such O
as O
fast B-ATTR

and O
low B-ATTR

hinder O
its O
commercial O

Herein, O
to O
solve O
the O

obtain O
nickel-rich O

designed O
and O
coated O
on O
the O

of O
LiNi0.84Co0.11Mn0.05O2 B-MAT

The O

composed O
of O
vanadium O
pentoxide O
( O
V2O5 B-MAT

( O

. O

The O
V2O5 B-MAT
could O
facilitate O
the O

of O
the O
nickel-rich O

stabilize O

the O
rGO B-MAT
with O
excellent B-ATTR
electronic I-ATTR

helpful O
to O

Therefore, O
the O
V2O5 B-MAT

rGO B-MAT
hybrid O
coating O

not O
only O
prevents O
the O

but O
also O
improves O
the O

The O

that O
the O

suffers O
from O
disadvantages O
such O

nickel-rich O
LiNi0.9Mn0.1O2 B-MAT

widely O
used O
